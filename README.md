# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz


## Overview
This project only used HTML, CSS, and Javascript and mostly focused on navigating the DOM through Javascript and to test our ability at creating a dynamic webpage. The HtML and CSS were very basic however, I 
made it look like the mock-up as much as possible, since again the JavaScript was the most important aspect of the challenge. The Code-Quiz begins with a page that allows you to either view past highscores or to
start the quiz. If you start the quiz, a timer will be set to 75 seconds and will decrease by 1 all the while receiing multiple choice question with options provided. If you guess wrong or right, you will be moved on to the next question; howver, a penalty of 10 seconds will be given if guessed incorrectly. If either you finish the quiz or the timer reaches 0 the quiz will end, and your score will be provided based on how much time is left.
Once finished if you decide to submit your score to be saved on the leaderboard, you must enter initials. Or you can choose to clear highscores to get rid of past highscores. This is a basic overview and below I have provided screenshotes to give an idea.
